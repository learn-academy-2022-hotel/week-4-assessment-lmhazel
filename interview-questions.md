# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: Object-oriented programming, also abbreviated to OOP, is programming that relies on object to be the fundamental building blocks of the program. Functional programming uses functions in order to run code. 

Researched answer: Object-oriented programming, also abbreviated to OOP, is programming that relies on object to be the fundamental building blocks of the program. An example of this would be Ruby. OOP typically uses assignes unique attributes and behavior to the objects so desired code can be run. Functional programming uses functions in order to run code. This is done by creating and applying functions on to variables. JavaScript is a combination of object-oriented and functional programming. 

1. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: A Float in Ruby is a partial number while Integer is a whole number.

Researched answer: In Ruby, a float is a partial number. Floats are also real numbers. An example of this is numbers that contain decimal points like 5.4. An integer is a whole number. For example, 5 is an integer. 

1. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: An implicit return means returns are implied. 

Researched answer: In Ruby, an implicit return is the rule that if return is to be executed in the last line of code, the return keyword is not needed. This is helpful because it cuts down on code. One of the many examples of how Ruby is human-centered. 

1. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: A block in Ruby is comparable to parameters in JavaScript in which an argument can be taken in for what the function acts upon.

Researched answer: In Ruby, blocks are anonymous functions that are enclosed in {curly braces} and can take multiple arguments. This can be compared to parameters in JavaScript in which an argument can be taken in for what the function acts upon.

1. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer: You can extract a value by doing HashName.value

Researched answer: One can extract a value by doing hashname[:value]. This can be useful when updating a key in a hash.
